# F3F Bukkit Plugin Configuration
# This file controls the behavior of the F3F render distance plugin for speedrunning servers

# Permission node required to change render distance
# Players with this permission can use F3+F to change render distance
permission-node: "f3f.change"

# Minimum render distance allowed (chunks)
# Players cannot set render distance below this value
min-render-distance: 2

# Maximum render distance allowed (chunks)
# Players cannot set render distance above this value
# Recommended: 32 for most servers, higher values may impact performance
max-render-distance: 32

# Enable automatic sync between client and server
# When enabled, client render distance changes are synced to server
# Useful for maintaining consistency in speedrunning environments
enable-auto-sync: true

# Enable F3+F key combination
# When disabled, the plugin will not respond to F3+F packets
enable-f3f-keys: true

# Cooldown between F3+F usages (milliseconds)
# Prevents spam clicking, recommended: 100-500ms
f3f-cooldown: 100

# Server update cooldown (milliseconds)
# Delay between server render distance updates to prevent conflicts
# Recommended: 1000ms for stability
server-update-cooldown: 1000

# Configurable messages
# Use %d for numbers, %s for strings
# Color codes: &0-&9, &a-&f, &l (bold), &o (italic), &n (underline), &m (strikethrough), &r (reset)
